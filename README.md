# agentic_ai_projects

A small collection of demo projects used in the course: a Part A in-memory city library management prototype and a Part B retail transactions analysis script that produces visuals and small aggregate reports.

## Quick setup & run (Windows, cmd.exe)

Checklist
- [ ] Install Python 3.8+ (recommended: 3.9–3.11).
- [ ] Create and activate a virtual environment.
- [ ] Install required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Run the demo scripts below.

1) Open a Windows command prompt and change to the project folder:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\lenovo\PycharmProjects\agentic_ai_couse_practice
```

2) Create a virtual environment and activate it (cmd.exe):

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you prefer PowerShell, use `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` instead.

3) Upgrade pip and install dependencies:

```cmd
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Run the Part A demo (library system):

```cmd
python part_a_library_system.py
```

This prints a short borrow/return demo and reports to the console.

5) Run the Part B analysis (retail transactions):

- By default the script looks for `Retail_Transactions_Dataset.csv` in the project root. To run with a specific CSV:

```cmd
python part_b_retail_analysis.py --csv path\to\Retail_Transactions_Dataset.csv
```

- Outputs (plots and an aggregate Excel) are written to `retail_outputs/` by default. Open that folder after the run to view PNGs and `key_aggregates.xlsx`.

Notes and troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, ensure your virtual environment is activated (the prompt will typically show `(.venv)` ).
- If `part_b_retail_analysis.py` fails with file-not-found, confirm the CSV path and column names expected by the script (it expects `Date`, `Total_Cost`, `City`, `Payment_Method`, `Season`, etc.).
- If matplotlib fails to create figures in a headless environment, try adding a non-interactive backend at the top of the script (e.g., `import matplotlib; matplotlib.use('Agg')`) or run the script on a machine with a GUI.
- `.gitignore` is included to ignore IDE and autogenerated files (`__pycache__/`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`, etc.).

Optional / advanced
- Use `pipx` to install command-line utilities globally (e.g., uvicorn) without affecting the project venv.
- To run the analysis non-interactively on a server, create the venv and install requirements as shown, ensure a writable `retail_outputs/` path, and run the script.

Contact / next steps
- If you want, I can add a small sample CSV (synthetic) and a single-command run script (`run_analysis.bat`) to make testing quicker. Tell me if you'd like that and I will add it.
